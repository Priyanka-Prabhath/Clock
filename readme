# Simple Clock Interface

This is a simple Python project that creates a clock interface using Python and its libraries. The clock displays the current time and updates in real-time.

## Features

- Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates the time dynamically.
- Simple and clean user interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
- Optionally, you can use `pip` to install any additional dependencies if needed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install any required libraries (if applicable).

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to launch the clock interface:
    ```bash
    python clock.py
    ```
2. The clock interface will appear, displaying the current time.

## Project Structure

- `clock.py`: The main script that contains the code for the clock interface.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for different time zones.
- Customize the clock's appearance (e.g., colors, fonts).
- Add an alarm or timer functionality.
